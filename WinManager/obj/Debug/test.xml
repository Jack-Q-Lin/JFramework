	<summary>
 To show the process indicaor:
   you can simply insert one line (calling this routine) into your LOOP.
   You can also insert one line (just befor your LOOP) caling this routine with parameter cMessage="ShowMessageOnly" or "ShowBarOnly" to force the indicator to be what you want.
   If you didn't pass the correct nTotalSteps of your loop, Or you set to ShowMessageOnly, you need to call ProcessIndicator("Finish") after your LOOP. 
      Otherwise the process indicator will stay displaying after your LOOP ended.
   If the LOOP is a uncountable loop, you can call ProcessIndicator("Start Timer") before the LOOP and call ProcessIndicator("Stop Timer") after the LOOP
